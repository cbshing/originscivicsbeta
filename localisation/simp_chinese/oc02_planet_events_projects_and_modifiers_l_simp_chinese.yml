As the mechanical whir of the atmospheric scrubbers dropped down to a silent stop, crowds around the capital and on our colonies erupted into celebration. Home, our home, was finally restored. For the first time in generations we [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] no longer need to wear environmental suits outdoors or use rebreathers over our [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesMouthName]s to breath on our home world.\n\nThe euphoria following this event will surely reverberate throughout our empire for some time."
